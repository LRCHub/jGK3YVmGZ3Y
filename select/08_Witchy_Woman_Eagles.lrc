[00:32.25] Raven hair and ruby lips
[00:36.71] Sparks fly from her fingertips
[00:41.89] Echoed voices in the night
[00:46.06] She's a restless spirit on an endless flight
[01:08.06] 
[00:51.93] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[00:56.22] See how high she flies
[01:00.74] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[01:05.58] She got the moon in her eyes
[01:19.58] 
[01:20.75] She held me spellbound in the night
[01:24.98] Dancing shadows and firelight
[01:30.04] Crazy laughter in another room
[01:35.34] And she drove herself to madness with a silver spoon
[02:01.34] 
[01:39.10] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[01:44.10] See how high she flies
[01:50.05] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[01:54.54] She got the moon in her eyes
[02:08.54] 
[03:18.52] Well, I know you want a lover
[03:22.73] Let me tell you, brother
[03:23.56] She's been sleepin' in the Devil's bed
[03:27.85] And there's some rumors going 'round
[03:30.56] Someone's underground
[03:32.31] She can rock you in the nighttime 'til your skin turns red
[04:01.31] 
[03:37.96] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[03:42.20] See how high she flies
[03:47.40] Woo-hoo, witchy woman
[03:52.36] She got the moon in her eyes
