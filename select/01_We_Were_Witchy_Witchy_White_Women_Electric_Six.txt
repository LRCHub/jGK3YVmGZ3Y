I was on the inside looking out for you
You were on the outside looking in
We were a witchy coven of white women
We knew a lot about a regional sin
We were protected by the police crime wave
Gangster computer with a bloodied touch
There were so many of us
Or not enough
Or maybe much too much
TOO MUCH! TOO MUCH!
I met you on a Monday
It was Friday night
You were doin' alright cause it was Saturday night
and we were night bitches, white witches
We lived under the city
We were doin' alright
We ran around in circles casting spells all night
Terrorizing kids and causing a fight
I put a spell on you
You put a spell on me
Though we just couldn't spell love without consulting a white
She said
Some girls wished to think were teenage bitches
Other girls wanna be lesbian witches
But I'm wishy washy
Or wishy wishy
I just wish someone would watch me when I get too witchy now
We were married by the priestess all night
Lesbian lovers till the day we die
We were hot girls
But we had a query
If which marries witch which witch am I
But every fairy tale has to end some time honey
The chief of police, he wanted too much money
Pulled up his britches
Like up a bunch of bitches
Threw away the key cause he thought it was funny
So that's the story of how we found each other
Living as witches in a and L.A. cave
We rock stars
Baby, We were white women
We were trouble, trouble, trouble
We just couldn't behave
Now were just dancin' for the boys in the coast guard
Nobody knows we were once witches in love
They treat us so bad
Makes us so sad
We just cry, cry like when doves cry like a dove
But every now and then we get a reminder of
The days when we could wrap ourselves in witchy, witchy love
I go up on you
You go down on me
We go round, round, round
And we strap on the dirty glove
Go to the store and now get us something good to eat baby
Microwave cheese sashimi
Cause it takes blood sugar
and lots of energy to shuffle your feet
And go dancing with me tonight
Tonight!
Tonight!
Tonight!
