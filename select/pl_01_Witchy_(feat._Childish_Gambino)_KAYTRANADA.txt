Magic
It's something special in
the moment
It's 2:15 up in the mornin'
I'm talkin' to you, but
I'm really tryna hold your hand
Spirits
They're all around you,
can you feel it?
My niggas don't believe
in crystals
They see you dancin', girl,
they watch it go off
I can feel you in the night
(No lie)
I don't want no other vibe
(No lie)
I've been missing somethin'
That I cannot control
When I'm near, in your arms
In your eyes, I realize
It's voodoo
(Yeah, now)
You make me feel like I've
been floatin'
(Oh, no)
This ain't a spell, you got
me open, girl
You're bein' witchy and I
love it, girl
Can you feel it?
Girl, don't wanna lie
Girl, don't wanna lie
Girl, been holdin on to me, yeah
To me, yeah
Potion
We drinkin' somethin', now
I'm spinnin'
You got me thinkin'
somethin's in it
He's got me feelin' like I
wanna be your boyfriend
I can feel you in the night
(No lie)
I don't want no other vibe
(No lie)
I've been missing somethin'
That I cannot control
When I'm near, in your arms
In your eyes, I realize
It's voodoo
(Yeah, now)
You make me feel like I've
been floatin'
(Oh, no)
This ain't a spell, you got
me open, girl
You're bein' witchy and I
